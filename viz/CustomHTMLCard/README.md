This visualization helps user to create custom HTML cards using the row data given as input by the user. 
Each cell from the row is read and the whole row is shown as HTML card to the user. User can customize the HTML cards by providing 
styling in the "Style" tab. User can mention the styling for the HTML body and row using the tags and class names. The classname for the row data is ".row". Sample styling looks like: "body{background-color:#aebecf} .row{float:left;width:30%;margin:0.5em;border:0.05em solid black;}"
